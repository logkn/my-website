*FluxNCPs.jl* is a Julia implementation of [Python NCPs](https://ncps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for [Flux.jl]("https://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/stable/"). 

[Neural Circuit Policies](https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/publik_292280.pdf) are recurrent neural networks modeled after the differential equations observed in the brain of the nematode *C. Elegans*. They exhibit:
- **Neuroplasticity** - the neural connections change depending on inputs (observation and hidden state)
- **Causal Inference** - learning causal mappings between inputs and outputs
- **High Expressivity** - from the linked paper above, an NCP network with only 19 neurons was able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on self-driving tasks

*Julia package release coming soon*
