# FinML.jl

*FinML.jl* is a Julia library for experimenting with machine learning (including reinforcement learning algorithms) applied to financial data in Julia.

## Why Julia?
While similar libraries exist in Python, they are often restricted by the size of the training data. [DataFrames.jl](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/) or [InMemoryDatasets.jl](https://docs.juliahub.com/InMemoryDatasets/cS87e/0.6.2/) tends to be over an order of magnitude faster than Pandas for handling large datasets.

For reference
1. Importing from three OHLCV CSVs
2. Combining into one Dataset with over 10 million rows, and
3. Reindexing to account for missing datetimes for all assets
takes FinML.jl only 3 seconds

## Features
1. Importing (single or multi CSV)
2. Adding technical indicators with interpretable strings
3. Per-asset grouping
4. Customizable environment generation for RL
5. Strategy creation
6. Detailed strategy benchmarking and comparison

*Expected to release on GitHub by end of 2023*
